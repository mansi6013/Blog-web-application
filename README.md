The Blog Web Application project is designed to provide a platform for users to create, share, and manage blog posts. The system allows users to register, log in, and interact with the blog content by creating, editing, viewing, and deactivating their own blog posts. Admin users have additional privileges to manage the application by handling user accounts and controlling blog content.
This application is built with a Python backend using flask framework. MongoDB for data storage, and HTML, CSS for the frontend. It offers users a dynamic interface to post blogs, edit them, and interact with others' posts. Moreover, the system is equipped with authentication mechanisms that ensure only registered users can create or manage their blogs.
